## 💥 Features

* 🎭 **Mood-Sensitive Header**  
  A sentient header that responds emotionally to user behavior — commenting, judging, reacting.

* 🔘 **Annoying Button**  
  A hyperactive button that dodges interaction and makes clicking a psychological game.

* 📺 **VHS Television**  
  Retro-styled display with multiple bizarre “channels” — left unexplained for dramatic effect.

* 💻 **Working Terminal**  
  A fake (but interactive) command line with random commands, Easter eggs, and chaos.

  Unlisted components scattered across the UI. You'll know when you meet them... or they meet you.
